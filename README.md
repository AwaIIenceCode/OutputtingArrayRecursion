# RecursiveArrayTask

A C# console application that demonstrates recursion by generating and printing an array of random integers.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AwaIIenceCode/OutputtingArrayRecursion.git`
2. Open in Visual Studio or Rider.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Observe the console output displaying a randomly generated array of 15 integers.

## Features
- Uses a recursive `Generaterray` method to populate an array with random integers between -11 and 11.
- Implements a recursive `PrintArray` method to display array elements.
- Array size is fixed at 15 elements.
- Utilizes `Random` class for generating values.

## Usage Example
Output example: 3 -7 4 0 -11 9 -2 5 1 -8 6 -3 10 -5 2
